# 🛍️ Customer Purchase Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on their demographic information, website behavior, and purchasing history. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze key factors like age, income, product category, time spent on the website, and more to build a predictive model.

## 📁 Project Features

- Load and clean customer data using Pandas
- Handle missing values and prepare the dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Encode categorical variables and scale numerical ones
- Build classification models to predict purchase behavior
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and other metrics
- Tune model parameters for better results

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🎯 Goal

To understand customer behavior and develop a model that predicts whether a customer will complete a purchase, helping businesses improve their marketing and customer engagement strategies.
